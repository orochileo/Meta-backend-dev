Users need to interact with the objects on the webpage such as the reaction icons, or the comment button.

An HTML document must be represented in a certain way so that JavaScript code can query and update it. We use Document Object Model(DOM) to do this.

When your browser receives an HTML page, it constructs a DOM to represent it. DOM is a tree structure of the objects.

The DOM has a series of objects, each representing a single HTML document.

                      /      \
                  head        body
                    |          /  \
                  title     div    div
                    |       |      |
                  text      h1     p
                            |      |
