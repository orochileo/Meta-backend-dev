When a user enters data on a website, an HTML form submits an HTTP request containing the data to the server.
Forms can be defined using HTML form tags.
<form></form>
Forms also have an optional attibute called Action. Action specifies the URL or path that the form should submit the request to. E.g. <form action="/registration" method="POST"></form>
If the action is not specified, the form will submit the request to the same path as the current webpage.

There's also a form method. With the form method, you can specify the HTTP method to use for the HTTP request. There are two HTTP methods to submit the form data,
GET and POST.

Text field. The fields of a form are specified by input tags. <input type="text" name="username" /> ONLY FOR SINGLE-LINE TEXT INPUT
You can also add a label tag to make it look nicer. <label for="username">Username:</label><br>
In HTML, password field is masked for security concerns. <input type="password" />
Lastly, you need to add a submit field to complete the form. <input type="submit" />
Other input types: checkbox <input type="checkbox" name="dog" value="Dog" />
                   radio buttion <input type="radio" name="right" value="Right" /> radio button is a single button that automatically unchecks all other buttons when selected
