Framework: like Spring, is a structure instructing you how to develop your software
Library: a piece of reusable code, used to realize a functionality
APIs: some common APIs - browser API, REST API, sensor-based API. APIs are often the bridge between different components and systems(earns API the name of gateway or middleware).
DOM API: turns the HTML document into a tree of nodes that are represented as JS objects.
REST API(or RESTful) provides data for popular web and mobile apps.
Sensor-based APIs: used in IoT, which communicates information between different objects.
RESTful API: a web server that provides responses to requests. GET/POST/DELETE/PUT data.

APIs use endpoints to specify how different resources can be accessed. The endpoint is built into the URL when accessing the API.
Two common forms of API responses are: full webpages, and a data form based on JS called JSON.
