Some popular authentication methods for REST APIs include: 
 
1. Basic Authentication: 
Involves sending a username and password with each request, but can be less secure without encryption. 
 
When to use: 
Suitable for simple applications where security and encryption arenâ€™t the primary concern or when used over secured connections. 
 
2. Token Authentication: 
Uses generated tokens, like JSON Web Tokens (JWT), exchanged between client and server, offering enhanced security without sending login credentials with each request. 
 
When to use: 
Ideal for more secure and scalable systems, especially when avoiding sending login credentials with each request is a priority. 
 
3. OAuth Authentication: 
Enables third-party limited access to user resources without revealing credentials by issuing access tokens after user authentication. 
 
When to use: 
Ideal for scenarios requiring controlled access to user resources by third-party applications or services. 
 
4. API Key Authentication: 
Assigns unique keys to users or applications, sent in headers or parameters; while simple, it might lack the security features of token-based or OAuth methods. 
 
When to use: 
Convenient for straightforward access control in less sensitive environments or for granting access to certain functionalities without the need for user-specific permissions.
