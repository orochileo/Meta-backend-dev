The web browser has a normal way of calculating the position of HTML elements on the screen called document flow.
Two main categories: block and inline.
A block level element will occupy the full horizontal width of its parent element and the vertical height of its content. Each block level element will have a new line before and after.
Inline elements only occupy the width and height of their content. They don't appear on a new line, hence the name inline. Multiple inline elements can form a row of elements.

Block level elements:
<div></div>
<form></form>
<h1></h1>...

Inline elements:
<a href="index.html"></a>
<img src="felafel.jpeg">
<input>
<label></label>
<b></b>
<i></i>
<em></em>
<span></span>
