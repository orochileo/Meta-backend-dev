When you shop online, you will always get recommendations based on personal taste. How do they do that?

Static content is files that the server transfers just as they are stored on the web server, such as videos or images.
Dynamic content is generated when the HTTP request is made. They can be generated based on input from the user, or when you visit a news website,
it would be based on current date. 

How are dynamic contents generated? Actually a web server communicates with application server/backend, the application server generates the dynamic
content and send it back to web server and the web server will send it back to the user's browser.

Application server would 1)run application logic; 2)communicate with database; and 3)check permissions.
Generating dynamic content in real-time is time consuming. So they used a technique called CACHING.
