HTML being the frame and the structure of a webpage.
CSS is the paint, wallpaper, fixtures, artwork, and overall style or look and feel.
CSS tells the web browser how to display HTML elements on screen.

Five elements essential to CSS:
1. A declaration block: starts with a left curly bracket and ends with the matching right curly bracket. In between these curly brackets are the style declarations.
2. Selector: Indicates which HTML element or elements we want to style.
3. Property and value:  background-color: grey

To link a CSS file to index.html, you need to declare it in the head tag. You need to use a link tag <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"/>
If I want it to only apply to one element, I'll add an id tag to the element I want to select, then apply it in the CSS rule. <h1 id="header1">Chapter One</h1>, then in the style.css,
#header1 { color : green }
